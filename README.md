# snake_game

## Here we implement the iconic Snake Game using the Turtle class from the Python turtle package. We institute a few different classes, Snake, Food, and Scoreboard to build out our different objects.

## Our snake consists of a list of Turtle objects and moves based on user selecting to move up, right, left, and down. The Turtle class is useful in this circumstance as we can select the object to move, return it's position, and listen for key commands.
